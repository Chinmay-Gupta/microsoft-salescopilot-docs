## Root cause and resolution

### Issue 1: User doesn't have required security roles assigned

### Root cause

To use Copilot for Sales, users must have a valid Dynamics 365 license and appropriate security roles assigned to them. These roles have required permissions for Copilot for Sales to work properly.

### Resolution

The following security roles must be assigned to each user using Copilot for Sales:

- Salesperson
- Basic User
- Copilot for Sales User or Viva Sales User

For information about how to assign security roles to users, see [Assign a security role to a user](/power-platform/admin/assign-security-roles).
