[Power BI template apps](/power-bi/service-template-apps-overview) are integrated packages of pre-built Power BI dashboards and reports. Using Power BI template apps provides a convenient, powerful, and quick way to access and analyze your sellers' conversation data.

You can connect to and analyze conversation data by using the **Copilot for Sales dashboard** template app.

Sales managers are responsible for managing sales representatives who work with customers to close deals every day. Sales managers need to have visibility into their teams' customer conversations, where valuable information is shared about customers' needs, concerns, objections and competition​​.

With the **Copilot for Sales dashboard** template app, managers can measure and guide their sellers' activities without physically shadowing them. This helps them understand how sellers are performing, so that they can take corrective measures, provide appropriate guidance to sellers, and improve customer experience.

As a sales manager, use this dashboard to:

-   Coach sellers to improve their sales interactions

-   Understand your customers and analyze market trends

-   Get insights which will help you build a sales strategy
