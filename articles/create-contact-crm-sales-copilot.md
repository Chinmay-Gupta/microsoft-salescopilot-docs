# Create a contact in your CRM from Copilot for Sales

If an external contact doesn't exist in your CRM, create a contact in the CRM right from Copilot for Sales.

> [!TIP]
> Enter the contact's email address in the following format when you compose an email or meeting invitation: **FirstName LastName &lt;email address&gt;**. If you do, the corresponding items in the CRM contact form fill automatically.

## One external contact

1. In the **Copilot for Sales** pane, select **Add contact** on the **Highlights** tab.

    Alternatively, you can select the **Dynamics 365** or **Salesforce** tab, hover over the unsaved contact, and then select **Add to Dynamics 365** or **Add to Salesforce**.

1. In the **New contact** form, add the required information, and then select **Save**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If your administrator has disabled the inline contact creation, the **New Contact** form opens in your CRM to fill in the details. More information: [Configure new contact creation](customize-forms-and-fields.md#configure-new-contact-creation).

   > [!NOTE]
   > You can also open the contact form in your CRM. Select **Open in Dynamics 365** or **Open in Salesforce**, and then enter details.

   Copilot for Sales automatically connects the new CRM contact to your external contact.

## Multiple external contacts

1. In the **Copilot for Sales** pane, select **Add contacts** on the **Highlights** tab.

    Copilot for Sales automatically connects the new CRM contact to your external contact.

## Signature available in email

If you open the **Copilot for Sales** pane from an incoming email that contains the signature of the sender, and you add the contact to your CRM, Copilot for Sales prefills the contact details based on the signature and highlights the fields that it populated. You can update the information and select **Save**.

> [!NOTE]
> This capability is available only for emails in English.
