## Root cause and resolution

### Issue 1: User doesn't have Write access to an entity in Salesforce

#### Root cause

When a user tries to edit an entity, Sales Copilot checks if the user has **Write** access to the entity in Salesforce. If the user doesn't have **Write** access to the entity, the error message is displayed.

You can confirm if the user not having **Write** access to the entity is the root cause of issue if you see the following error in the logs:

```
Exception thrown in VivaSalesContacts/UpdateContact - 
Microsoft.SalesProductivity.Common.Base.SPServiceException: Salesforce failed to complete task: Message: entity is deleted clientRequestId: 01665660-aeb5-45fe-83d3-59bf69f1e85e-self ---> 
System.Exception: { 
    "status": 400, 
    "message": "Object type contact is not supported. If you are attempting to use a custom object, be sure to append the '__c' after the entity name. 
                Please reference your WSDL or the describe call for the appropriate names\r\nclientRequestId: <CLIENT REQUEST ID>-self", 
    "error": null, 
    "source": "Salesforce.Common", 
    "errors": [] 
}

```

In the above error message, the `Object type contact is not supported` indicates that the user doesn't have **Write** access to the Contact entity.

#### Resolution

To resolve the issue, ensure that the user has:

- Read/write level permissions to the entity which the user is trying to edit in Salesforce
- Read/write permissions on all of the fields configured for editing
- Access to the specific record that the user is trying to edit

For information about object-level security, field-level security, and record-level security in Salesforce, see [Control Who Sees What](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.security_data_access.htm&type=5). You can also contact your Salesforce administrator for help in setting permissions correctly.
