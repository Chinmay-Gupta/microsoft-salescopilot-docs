# Viva Sales deployment guide for Dynamics 365 customers

This guide provides you with step-by-step instructions on how to deploy Viva Sales for existing Dynamics 365 Sales customers.

> [!VIDEO https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/videoplayer/embed/RW10Mca]

## Step 1: Installing and auto deploying the Viva Sales Outlook Add-in

Viva Sales requires a tenant administrator to install the integrated app from the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/). See [FAQ](#how-do-i-find-my-tenant-admin) for tips on finding your tenant administrator.

Follow the steps in the [Install Viva Sales add-in for Outlook](install-viva-sales-as-an-integrated-app.md) article to install and automatically deploy the Viva Sales Outlook add-in.

![Screenshot showing Viva Sales installed as an add-in for Outlook.](media/install-viva-sales.png "Screenshot showing Viva Sales installed as an integrated app.")

## Step 2: Create a setup policy to auto install and pin the Viva Sales app in Teams

Viva Sales requires an administrator to create the policy from the [Teams admin center](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/dashboard).

Follow the steps in the [Install and pin Viva Sales in Teams](install-pin-viva-sales-teams.md) article to install and pin the Viva Sales Teams app in your users' personal Teams environment and in meetings they create.

## Step 3: Enable Teams meeting transcripts

When Viva Sales is added to a Teams meeting, it generates a meeting summary automatically if the meeting is recorded with transcription on.

To enable transcripts for Teams calls for Sales conversational intelligence:

1.  Sign in to the [Teams admin center](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com).

2.  In the left pane, select **Meetings** &gt; **Meeting policies**.

3.  On the **Manage policies** tab, select **Add**.

4.  Select **Global (Org-wide default)** from the middle pane.

5.  On the new **Global (Org-wide default)** page, scroll down to the **Recording & transcription** section and enable the checkbox next to "Transcription".

6.  Select **Save**.

    ![Screenshot showing how to enable transcription in Teams admin center ](media/enable-transcription-teams.png "Screenshot showing how to enable transcription in Teams admin center.")

## Step 4: Verify users have the right security roles

If you're using the following out-of-the-box Dynamics 365 Sales security roles, no action is needed. Viva Sales privileges are added automatically for:

-   Primary sales roles: Salesperson or Sales Manager

-   Administration roles: System Administrator or System Customizer

If you're using custom security roles, see [Additional privileges required for Dynamics 365 customers](install-viva-sales.md#additional-privileges-required-for-dynamics-365-customers) to assign users the right roles and privileges.

## Step 5 (optional): Customize Viva Sales

Viva Sales provides CRM administrator settings to control the seller's experience in Outlook and Teams. See the [Administrator settings for Viva Sales](administrator-settings-for-viva-sales.md) article to learn more.

![Screenshot showing Viva Sales admin center ](media/viva-sales-admin.png "Screenshot showing Viva Sales admin center.")

Viva Sales comes preconfigured to allow users to be productive out-of-the-box. We understand the default CRM fields shown may not work for everyone. To customize the fields, follow the instructions in the [Customize forms and fields](customize-forms-and-fields.md) article.

![Screenshot showing form settings in Viva Sales admin center ](media/viva-sales-forms-admin.png "Screenshot showing form settings in Viva Sales admin center.")

You can set up Copilot in Viva Sales to use copilot features that are in preview or generally available. More information: [Set up Copilot in Viva Sales](suggested-replies.md).

![Screenshot showing Copilot settings in Viva Sales admin center ](media/viva-sales-replies-admin.png "Screenshot showing Copilot settings in Viva Sales admin center.")

You have now installed and configured Viva Sales in Outlook and Teams.

## Step 6: Welcome sellers in your organization to Viva Sales

Here's an example email message to share with your sellers, welcoming them to Viva Sales.

## Automatic installation

To make onboarding to Viva Sales easier for select organizations, Microsoft will automatically install Viva Sales for all users with an appropriate license. The license can either be a Viva Sales license or a product that includes Viva Sales such as Dynamics 365 Sales Enterprise or Dynamics 365 Sales Premium.

Auto installation is rolled out in phases to select organizations. Organization will receive a notification in both the **Microsoft 365 admin center** as well as the **Power Platform admin center**. Each organization can opt out of auto-installation in the specified period of time. Once the capablity is rolled-out, the Outlook add-in and Microsoft Teams app cannot be uninstalled from **Microsoft 365 admin center**, but users can choose to uninstall them from their respective Outlook and Teams clients, and a new install will not be performed automatically.

Auto-installed apps are considered as user-deployed and will not have full feature support. User-deployed apps don't support Viva Sales banner notifications that appear within the top of new or reply emails. Also, the Viva Sales is not added automatically to meeting invites. However, sellers can manually add Viva Sales to the meeting to get meeting summaries. To get full feature support such as banner notifications, you must install the app for your sellers from **Microsoft 365 admin center**. In this way, the apps will be considered as admin-deployed and will have full feature support.
