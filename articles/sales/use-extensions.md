# Use extensions

You can use extensions to integrate with third-party applications. Integration helps you enhance the functionality of Sales Copilot and add insights for your salespeople.

## Integrate with People.ai

Integrate with People.ai to get insights into your sellers' activities and their engagement with customers. The insights are based on the data that is collected from your sellers' email and meeting. By default, the integration is disabled. When enabled, the insights are displayed in the opportunity summary.

### Prerequisites

You must generate an API key and API secret in People.ai. They are used to authenticate and connect you with People.ai. 

### Turn on People.ai integration

1.  In Sales Copilot admin settings, select **Extensions**.

2.  Turn on **People.ai (preview)**.

3. Enter the values for **API key** and **API Secret**. 

4. Select **Save**.
