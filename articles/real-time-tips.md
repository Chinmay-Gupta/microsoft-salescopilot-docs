# Real-time sales tips

As a seller, you can get real-time sales tips during your customer meetings in the Sales Copilot panel in Microsoft Teams. These tips provide information about competitors or brands mentioned by customers in the meeting, and help you respond to customer inquiries. The information you need is right in front of you, and this leads to better communication and helps you close deals faster.

> - You must transcribe the meeting to get real-time sales tips.
> - You must check the content carefully. AI-generated summaries may be missing information and can contain inaccurate details.

## View real-time sales tips

To view real-time sales tips during a meeting, select the **Sales Copilot** icon on the meeting toolbar. The **Sales Copilot** panel opens on the right side of the meeting window. If you don't see the **Sales Copilot** icon, select **Apps**, and then select **Sales Copilot**.

If you don't start transcribing the meeting, you'll see a banner that encourages you to record the meeting to get real-time sales tips.

An introduction card is displayed in the Sales Copilot panel explaining how real-time sales tips work and the benefits it offers. If the meeting is connected to an opportunity in CRM, an [opportunity summary](view-opportunity-summary.md) card is displayed that shows the key details and status of the current opportunity.

When you start recording the meeting, the real-time sales tips are displayed in the **Sales Copilot** panel. The real-time sales tips are displayed as cards that contain information about competitors or brands mentioned by customers in the meeting, and help you respond to customer inquiries. You must select **Get brand info** or **Get competitor info** to view detailed information.

The brand information is based on Bing knowledge graph. The competitor information is available only for Dynamics 365 customers and it's based on the out-of-the-box competitor table in Dynamics 365.
