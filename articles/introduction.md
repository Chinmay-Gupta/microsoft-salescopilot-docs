# Welcome to Microsoft Copilot for Sales

Microsoft Copilot for Sales is a seller experience application that uses Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Teams to automatically capture, access, and register data into any customer relationship management (CRM) system. It eliminates manual data entry and gives sellers more time to focus on selling. By enriching the data set with customer engagement data from Microsoft 365 and the power of AI, Copilot for Sales empowers sellers with sales intelligence that helps them deeply understand their customers for faster deal closure. Copilot for Sales is designed to help sellers boost productivity, lighten workloads, save time, and help salespeople sell more.
