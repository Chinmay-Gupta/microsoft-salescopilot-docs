## Root cause and resolution

### Issue 1: User doesn't have API permissions 

#### Root cause

The issue occurs when the user doesn't have API permissions in Salesforce. You can confirm if this is the root cause of the issue if you see the following error in the logs:

```
Exception thrown in VivaSalesContacts/GetContactsByEmailAddress - 
Microsoft.SalesProductivity.Common.Base.SPServiceException: Salesforce failed to complete task: Message: entity is deleted clientRequestId: {CLIENT REQUEST ID HERE}-self ---> 
System.Exception: { 
    "error": { 
        "code": 502, 
        "source": "{APIM SOURCE}", 
        "message": "BadGateway", 
        "innerError": { 
            "status": 502, 
            "message": "Salesforce failed to complete task: Message: **API is disabled for this User**\r\nclientRequestId: {CLIENT REQUEST ID HERE}", 
            "error": null, 
            "source": "Salesforce.Common", 
            "errors": [] 
        } 
    } 
} 
```

#### Resolution

You must grant the **API Enabled** permission the user or user profile for the affected user.

1. Sign in to Salesforce as an administrator.

1. In the search box, enter **User**.

1. In the left navigation pane, select **Profiles**, and then select the profile for the affected user.

1. In the **Administrative Permissions** section, select **API Enabled**. 

1. Select **Save**.
