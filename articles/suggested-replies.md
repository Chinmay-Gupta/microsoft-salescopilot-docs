# Turn on Copilot AI features

Sales Copilot can use communication with sales contacts and information from your organization's customer relationship management (CRM) system to derive AI-powered insights that help your sellers write better emails, take better notes, and stay on top of their deals. As a tenant administrator or CRM administrator, you can set up Copilot AI features for your entire organization (tenant administrator) or specific environments (CRM administrator).

Copilot AI features might or might not be turned on by default, depending on where your tenant is located. For instance, if you're a new customer, your Dynamics 365 organization is located in North America or Europe, and your CRM resides in the same geography as Microsoft Entra ID, then Copilot AI features are turned on by default. Otherwise, you need to turn them on before your sellers can use them.

Copilot AI features in Sales Copilot are available only in some [supported languages](supported-languages.md).

## Turn on Copilot AI features for your organization

As a tenant administrator, you can control who can use AI capabilities in Sales Copilot for all environments in your organization. If you turn off Copilot AI features for your organization, CRM administrators can't turn them on in their environments.

1. [Open Sales Copilot administrator settings](./administrator-settings-for-viva-sales.md#access-administrator-settings).

1. Under **Tenant**, select **Copilot**.

    - **The entire organization**: Turns on Copilot AI features for all sellers in all environments in your organization.

The following Copilot AI features are generally available:

- **Generate suggested email content**: Offers content that's generated using context from Outlook and your CRM, making it easy for sellers to compose or reply to emails quickly and confidently.

    *The AI-generated content is just a suggestion.* It's the seller's responsibility to review and edit the suggested content to make sure it's accurate and appropriate before sending the message.
