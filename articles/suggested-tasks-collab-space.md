# View suggested tasks

Sales team members spend a lot of time communicating and coordinating with colleagues within Microsoft Teams. They work on important decisions and action items that are related to their accounts and opportunities. However, it's easy to lose track of tasks and to-dos when you're working in a fast-paced environment.

Copilot for Sales in Teams helps sellers to stay on top of their tasks and to-dos by suggesting tasks that are related to their accounts and opportunities. The tasks are suggested based on the conversations in Teams channels that have the Copilot for Sales bot installed. Tasks are suggested once every 24 hours for new posts and replies in the channel.

Key benefits of the suggested tasks feature are:

- **Automated prompting**: Copilot for Sales scans the conversations in the channel for relevant discussions and action items. When it finds a potential task, it suggests the task to the channel members, who can then decide whether to add the task to their task list.
- **Task creation and assignment**: Channel members can create tasks from the suggested tasks and assign them to themselves or to other channel members. Preview of the task is shown to the user creating the task.
- **Tasks app integration**: The Tasks app is pinned as a tab in the channel. When a task is created from a suggested task, it's added to the Tasks app in Teams. Channel members can also view and manage their tasks from the Tasks personal app in Teams.

## Create tasks from suggested tasks

1. Open an account team or deal room channel in Microsoft Teams. 

    If task suggestions are available, you'll see the **Suggested tasks** card for a post in the channel.

2. In the **Suggested tasks** card, review the suggested tasks. Task name, assignee, due date, and citation number are shown for each task. Select the citiation number to see the text from the conversation that led to the task suggestion.

3. If required, edit the task details inline. You can change the task name, assignee, and due date.

4. Perform one of the following actions:
    - If there's only one task, select **Create task**. 
    - If there are multiple tasks, select the tasks you want to create, and then select **Create selected tasks**.

4. In the confirmation message, select **Go to tasks** to view the created tasks in the **Tasks** tab. Alternatively, you can view the tasks in the Planner app in Teams.
