# Create a Teams meeting

Your Copilot for Sales journey starts when you schedule a Microsoft Teams meeting and invite at least one external participant. The Copilot for Sales app is added automatically to the meeting.

> Only meeting organizers can manually add the Copilot for Sales app to a Teams meeting.

Requirements for Copilot for Sales app to be added automatically to a Teams meeting:

- You must invite at least one external participant to the meeting.

- You must transcribe the meeting for Copilot for Sales to generate insights.

- If you create a recurring meeting, the Copilot for Sales app is added to all occurrences of the meeting.
