# Create a Teams meeting

Your Sales Copilot journey starts when you [schedule a Teams meeting from Outlook](https://support.microsoft.com/office/schedule-a-teams-meeting-from-outlook-883cc15c-580f-441a-92ea-0992c00a9b0f) or [schedule a meeting in Microsoft Teams](https://support.microsoft.com/office/schedule-a-meeting-in-microsoft-teams-943507a9-8583-4c58-b5d2-8ec8265e04e5), and invite at least one connected contact. The Sales Copilot app is added automatically to the meeting created. AÂ message is displayed that conversation insights will be generated if you record the meeting with transcription on.

Keep these important points about conversation insights in mind:

- You must invite at least one connected contact for Outlook to add the Sales Copilot app to the meeting.

- You must transcribe the meeting for Sales Copilot to generate insights.

- If you create a recurring meeting, Outlook adds the Sales Copilot app to all occurrences of the meeting.

- The Sales Copilot app is added automatically to the meeting only when Outlook has the [minimum required version](sales-copilot-faq.md#whats-the-minimum-version-of-outlook-required-for-sales-copilot).
