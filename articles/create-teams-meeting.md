# Create a Teams meeting

Your Copilot for Sales journey starts when you [create a Teams meeting in Outlook](https://support.microsoft.com/office/schedule-a-teams-meeting-from-outlook-883cc15c-580f-441a-92ea-0992c00a9b0f) and invite at least one connected contact. The Copilot for Sales app is added automatically to the meeting created using Outlook for Windows, Mac, or web. A message is displayed that conversation insights will be generated if you record the meeting with transcription on.

> [!NOTE]
> If you create a meeting directly from Teams calendar, you must [add the app manually](sales-copilot-faq.md#how-can-i-add-the-copilot-for-sales-app-manually-to-a-teams-meeting).

Keep these important points about conversation insights in mind:

- You must create the meeting in Outlook and turn on the **Teams meeting** toggle. If you create the meeting in Teams, the Copilot for Sales app isn't added to the meeting and meeting insights aren't generated.

- You must invite at least one connected contact for Outlook to add the Copilot for Sales app to the meeting.

- You must transcribe the meeting for Copilot for Sales to generate insights.

- If you create a recurring meeting, Outlook adds the Copilot for Sales app to all occurrences of the meeting.

- The Copilot for Sales app is added automatically to the meeting only when Outlook has the [minimum required version](sales-copilot-faq.md#whats-the-minimum-version-of-outlook-required-for-copilot-for-sales).
