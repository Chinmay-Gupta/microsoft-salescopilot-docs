# Create a Teams meeting

Your Sales Copilot journey starts when you schedule a Microsoft Teams meeting and invite at least one external participant who is also a connected contact. The Sales Copilot app is added automatically to the meeting. A message is displayed that conversation insights will be generated if you record the meeting with transcription on.

> [!NOTE]
> Only meeting organizers can [manually add the Copilot for Sales app](sales-copilot-faq.md#how-can-i-add-the-copilot-for-sales-app-manually-to-a-teams-meeting) to a Teams meeting.

Keep these important points about conversation insights in mind:

- You must invite at least one external participant, also a connected contact, for the Copilot for Sales app to be added to the meeting.

- You must transcribe the meeting for Copilot for Sales to generate insights.

- If you create a recurring meeting, Outlook adds the Copilot for Sales app to all occurrences of the meeting.
