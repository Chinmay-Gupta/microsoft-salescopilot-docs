# Create a Teams meeting

Your Sales Copilot journey starts when you schedule a Microsoft Teams meeting and invite at least one connected contact. The Sales Copilot app is added automatically to the meeting. A message is displayed that conversation insights will be generated if you record the meeting with transcription on.

Keep these important points about conversation insights in mind:

- You must invite at least one connected contact for the Sales Copilot app to be added to the meeting.

- You must transcribe the meeting for Sales Copilot to generate insights.

- If you create a recurring meeting, the Sales Copilot app is added to all occurrences of the meeting.

- The Sales Copilot app is added automatically to the meeting only when Outlook has the [minimum required version](sales-copilot-faq.md#whats-the-minimum-version-of-outlook-required-for-sales-copilot).
