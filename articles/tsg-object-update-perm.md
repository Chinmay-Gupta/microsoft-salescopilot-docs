## Root cause and resolution

### Issue 1: User doesn't have edit access to an object in Salesforce

#### Root cause

When a user tries to edit an object, Sales Copilot checks if the user has **Write** access to the object in Salesforce. If the user doesn't have **Write** access to the object, the error message is displayed.

You can confirm if the user not having **Write** access to the entity is the root cause of issue if you see the following error in the logs:

```
Exception thrown in VivaSalesContacts/UpdateContact -  
Microsoft.SalesProductivity.Common.Base.SPServiceException: Salesforce failed to complete task: Message: entity is deleted clientRequestId: 01665660-aeb5-45fe-83d3-59bf69f1e85e-self --->  
System.Exception: {  
    "status": 400,  
    "message": "Object type contact is not supported. If you are attempting to use a custom object, be sure to append the '__c' after the entity name.  
                Please reference your WSDL or the describe call for the appropriate names\r\nclientRequestId: <CLIENT REQUEST ID>-self",  
    "error": null,  
    "source": "Salesforce.Common",  
    "errors": []  
} 

```

In the above error message, the `Object type contact is not supported` indicates that the user doesn't have **Write** access to the Contact object.

#### Resolution

To resolve the issue, ensure that the user has:

- Read/write level permissions to the object that the user is trying to edit in Salesforce
- Read/write permissions on all of the fields configured for editing

For information about object-level security, field-level security, and record-level security in Salesforce, see [Control Who Sees What](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.security_data_access.htm&type=5). You can also contact your Salesforce administrator for help with [setting object permissions in profiles](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.perm_sets_object_perms_edit.htm&type=5).
