## Get sales data in the Teams Copilot chat

With Copilot for Sales plugin in the Teams Copilot chat, you can summarize sales data, catch up on customer meetings, get sales insights and CRM data within the chat using natural language prompts. Use the Teams Copilot chat to:

-   Get summaries of opportunity and account records to stay up to date with overall status and recent changes of the records. For example: Show account summary for Fourth Coffee.

-   Prepare for an upcoming meeting by getting key insights to catch-up before the meeting. For example: Help me prepare for the meeting 10 automatic coffee machines. The report is generated using the selected meeting and the opportunity where it's saved. If the meeting is not connected to an opportunity, a top ranked opportunity is selected by AI. Select **Open meeting** to open the meeting in Outlook.

-   Ask questions about sales KPIs such as win rate, sales cycle, sales pipeline, and weighted sales pipeline. For example: What's my sales cycle from Copilot for Sales?
