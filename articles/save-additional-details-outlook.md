# Configure fields to categorize emails and meetings in CRM

By categorizing emails and meetings in their CRM inbox, sellers can easily find and track their interactions with customers. For example, sellers might want to categorize emails and meetings based on priority, account, or deal stage. As a CRM administrator, you can configure these fields so that sellers can select them when they save emails or meetings to CRM.

## Prerequisites

CRM administrators must access administrator settings from the Copilot for Sales app in Teams. More information: [Administrator settings for Copilot for Sales](administrator-settings-for-viva-sales.md)

## Configure fields to save in CRM

1. In Copilot for Sales admin settings, select **Save to (CRM)**.

1. Select **Save email to (CRM)** or **Save meeting to (CRM)** depending on the type of activity you want to configure.
   You can select different fields to save along with the email or meeting to CRM. The fields you select are displayed to sellers when they save the email or meeting to CRM.

1. In the **Categorize with fields** section, select **Add fields** and select the fields from the **Add category** dialog.

1. Save the changes.

   Sellers can now see the fields you configured when they save emails or meetings to CRM.
