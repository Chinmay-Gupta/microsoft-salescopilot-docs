# EAP customer transition to Copilot for Sales FAQ

[Microsoft Ignite 2023](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/bdm/2023/11/15/introducing-new-copilot-experiences-to-boost-productivity-and-elevate-customer-experiences-across-the-organization/) introduced the next step in the journey with our Copilot products. Sales Copilot is rebranded to bring the power of Copilot for Microsoft 365 and the role specific insights and actions together under a new offering called Microsoft Copilot for Sales. This is the future sales product showcasing the better together of Copilot across your productivity applications. As a customer who has access to Sales Copilot through the Microsoft 365 Copilot early adopter program, we want you to be aware of this new update and on the options available and suggested next steps.

We've compiled a list of frequently asked questions and provided brief answers to help you get the required information quickly.

## What do I have access to?

You now have access to the latest Copilot for Sales capabilities at no additional cost. The new Copilot for Sales SKU includes Copilot for Microsoft 365 and the sales specific functionality. This is packaged together as a single license and fully integrated to show a powerful combined experience.

We have issued a unique code for your organization to redeem Copilot for Sales within 60 days and the code expires on May 15, 2024. Today, all Early Access Program (EAP) customers have access to use Copilot for Sales for up to 300 users for six months from when the code is activated. If you decide not to use this code, you will continue to see limited capabilities of Sales Copilot for the remainder of their pilot term. Microsoft strongly recommends upgrading to the new Copilot for Sales SKU to experience the full set of sales capabilities.

## Why am I getting access?

You are getting access to new Copilot for Sales licenses because you are an Early Access Program (EAP) customer who has already invested in this program to get early access to Microsoft Copilot. We appreciate your participation in the EAP program and recommend upgrading to the new Copilot for Sales SKU to experience the latest capabilities.

## How do I try Copilot for Sales?

Please check Microsoft Admin Message Center. You should have received a message in the message center with a link to activate a one-time access code. Only a global administrator or billing administrator can redeem the access code. Follow the instruction guide to learn how to use the code.

## What is the access code?

The code is a one-time use code that must be redeemed in 60 days and expires on May 15, 2024. The global or billing administrator must follow the steps in the instruction guide accurately, as the redemption process can only be attempted once. This is your unique code, do not share the link with anyone else.

## Who can activate the access code?

Only the global administrator or billing administrator can activate the access code. If you are not the global or billing administrator, do not click on the link. You must find your global tenant or billing administrator. Follow the instruction guide to deploy correctly.

## How can I find my global administrator?

1.  Sign in to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/).
1. In the left pane, select **Users** > **Active Users**.
1.  On the top right-hand corner, select the filter icon, and then select **Global Admins**. A list of users who are Global Admins on Office 365 is displayed.

## What does the access code do?

The access code adds 300 licenses for Copilot for Sales into your tenant. This is a limited time offer. The licenses can then be assigned to a user so that they can access all capabilities in the product for six months.

## How long do I have to redeem the access codes?

You have 60 days to redeem the code. The code expires on May 15, 2024.

## How long do I have access to the new licenses?

You have access to Microsoft Copilot for Sales for six months from the date you redeem the code. For example, if you redeem the access code on March 15, 2024, you will have access to Copilot for Sales until September 15, 2024.

## What happens after the licenses expire?

At the end of the six-month period, the licenses will expire, and you will no longer be able to use the EAP licenses. Ensure that you have plans to purchase the required licenses to continue using Copilot for Sales. You can contact your Microsoft account manager or partner for more information on how to purchase.

## What if I encounter an error redeeming the codes?

If you encounter any issues or errors while redeeming the offer, reach out to the support alias at [copilotforsalesineap@microsoft.com](copilotforsalesineap@microsoft.com) for assistance.

## How do I start adopting?

To use the new licenses, you must [assign the licenses to the users](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/assign-licenses-to-users?view=o365-worldwide) who will be using Copilot for Sales.

## Do I need to deactivate my old Sales Copilot licenses?

No, you do not need to deactivate your old Sales Copilot licenses.

## Do I need to reassign the old Sales Copilot license users?

No, you do not need to reassign users. Instead, you can assign the new Copilot for Sales licenses to the correct users.

## Once I receive the Copilot for Sales licenses, can I immediately start assigning licenses to users?

Yes, once you have received your Copilot for Sales licenses, they are available for assignment. You can start [assigning the licenses to users](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/assign-licenses-to-users?view=o365-worldwide) immediately.

## Do these licenses need to be assigned to the same users as Copilot for Microsoft 365?

No, Copilot for Sales licenses do not need to be assigned to the same users as Copilot for Microsoft 365. These licenses can be assigned to any user; however, we recommend that these licenses are assigned to sales teams for the most value.

## How will the experience change? 

If you are familiar with Sales Copilot, screens will be updated to display the new name Copilot for Sales and will have more detailed product experience. For more information, see: [What's new in Sales Copilot changing to Copilot for Sales](whats-new-copilot-sales.md)

## Why should I upgrade to Copilot for Sales?

Microsoft recommends upgrading to the new Copilot for Sales SKU to experience the latest sales innovations such as sales data and insights in Microsoft 365 Copilot, Word meeting preparation, and leads capture (currently in preview). For a full summary of the latest product updates, see: [What's new in Sales Copilot changing to Copilot for Sales](whats-new-copilot-sales.md).

## What about any data I have tested to date? 

All data from Sales Copilot testing will remain as you change the licenses, but new functionalities are added. There is no need to reinstall the app.

## Does any of this change impact my current 300 pilot licenses of Copilot for Microsoft 365? 

No! Copilot for Sales provides additional access to Copilot for Microsoft 365 and will not make any changes to existing Microsoft 365 Copilot license allocations.

## Who do I contact for help?

If you have any questions, contact your account team, attend the EAP customer community calls, or the support team at [copilotforsalesineap@microsoft.com](copilotforsalesineap@microsoft.com).
