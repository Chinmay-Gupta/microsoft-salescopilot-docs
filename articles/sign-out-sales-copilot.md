# Sign out of Sales Copilot

Signing out of Sales Copilot disconnects it from the CRM system. You'll need to sign in again to use Sales Copilot.

When you sign in and reconnect to the same CRM system and environment, your information is restored to the state it was in before you signed out. If you connect to a different CRM system or a different environment, the information is not restored.

In the **Sales**Â **Copilot** pane, select **Options** (**...**), and then select **Sign out.**
