# Sign out of Copilot for Sales

Signing out of Copilot for Sales disconnects it from the CRM system. You'll need to sign in again to use Copilot for Sales.

When you sign in and reconnect to the same CRM system and environment, your information is restored to the state it was in before you signed out. If you connect to a different CRM system or a different environment, the information is not restored.

In the **Sales**Â **Copilot** pane, select **Options** (**...**), and then select **Sign out.**
