# View recent communications in Copilot for Sales

If you've interacted with a customer recently using Outlook or Teams, you can view your recent email threads and Teams meetings with the first external contact in the **Recent communications** card in the Copilot for Sales pane in Outlook. You can get AI-based summaries of past email conversations, open the email thread in Outlook, and open the meeting chat in Teams. With this capability, you can quickly catch up on the the customer context and move deals forward with informed responses.

You can see up to three email threads and three Teams meetings in the last 30 days with the first external contact. The first external contact is the first contact in the email thread who isn't from your organization. It is determined based on the email address as follows:

|Outlook item|Read mode|Compose mode|
|---|---|---|
|Emails|Sender + To + Cc|To + Cc|
|Meetings|Organizer + Required + Optional|Required + Optional|

The **Recent communications** card retrieves the following communications from Graph:
- Communications from the external contact to you 
- Communications from you to the external contact 
- Communications from others to the external contact that include you 

> [!NOTE]
> - The **Recent communications** card shows previous email threads, not the previous responses in the current email thread.
> - The **Recent communications** card shows meetings that include a Teams meeting link. Meetings without a Teams meeting link aren't shown in the card.
