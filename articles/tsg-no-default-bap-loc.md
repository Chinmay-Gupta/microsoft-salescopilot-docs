## Root cause and resolution

### Issue 1: Default environment is not created in Power Apps

#### Root cause

Sales Copilot requires a Power Apps environment for every organization. When Sales Copilot is launched for the first time, it calls a Power Platform API to get the region details. If the organization does not have an existing Power Platform environment an error message is displayed when attempting to get region details.

#### Resolution

To resolve the issue, navigate to [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/). A default environment is created for the tenant.
