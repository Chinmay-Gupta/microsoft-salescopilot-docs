## Root cause and resolution

### Issue 1: Default environment is not created in Power Apps

#### Root cause

Sales copilot requires a default environment to be created in Power Apps to get region details. If Dynamics 365 license is not purchased for the tenant and first-run experience to Power Platform admin center has not happened, default environment is not created and sales copilot fails to discover region.

#### Resolution

To resolve the issue, navigate to [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/). A default environment is created for the tenant.
