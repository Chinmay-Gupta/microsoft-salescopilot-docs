## Root cause and resolution

### Issue 1: Bad OAuth token

#### Root cause

The Salesforce connection, created using the Salesforce connector, maintains the authentication tokens for the connected user. The same authentication tokens are used to communicate with Salesforce. The bad OAuth token error occurs when the Salesforce connection is unable to renew the authentication tokens. 

### Issue 2: Expired or invalid session

#### Root cause

The Salesforce session has reached its expiration time or the session has become invalid. This is based on the session configuration in Salesforce.

### Resolution

You must perform any one of the following steps to resolve the issue:

- Select **Sign in again** in the error message, and then sign in to Salesforce again.
- [Sign out from Copilot for Sales](sign-out-sales-copilot.md) and then sign in to Salesforce again.
