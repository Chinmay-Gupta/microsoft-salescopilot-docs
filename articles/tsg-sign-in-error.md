## Root cause and resolution

### Issue 1: Pop-up or cross-site tracking is blocked in the browser

#### Root cause

When you open the Sales Copilot Outlook add-in, an authentication pop-up window is opened to link the add-in to the current Outlook context. If pop-up or cross-site tracking is blocked in the browser, the add-in is not authenticated and the error message is displayed.

#### Resolution

You must allow pop-ups and cross-site tracking in the browser. Different browsers have different settings to allow pop-ups and cross-site tracking. We have provided the steps to allow pop-ups and cross-site tracking in the following browsers:

##### Edge

You'll receive a notification in the address bar if pop-ups are blocked. Select the option to always allow pop-ups from the Office 365 website. After you allow pop-ups, refresh the page, and then open the Sales Copilot add-in.

If the notification doesn't appear in the address bar, follow these steps:

1. Open browser settings.

1. In the left pane, select **Cookies and site permissions**.

1. In the right pane, select **Pop-ups and redirects**.

1. In the **Allow** section, select **Add**, enter `https://outlook.office365.com`, and then select **Add**.
