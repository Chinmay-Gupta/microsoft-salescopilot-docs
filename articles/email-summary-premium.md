# Summarize an email thread using sales information with Copilot in Outlook

Microsoft Copilot for Sales combines features from Copilot for Microsoft 365 to provide users with valuable insight to help support customer engagement. The combined Copilot experience in products like Microsoft Outlook support sellers by integrating Copilot's capabilities into Outlook and Copilot for Sales, creating a seamless 'better together' design. This feature enables sellers to grow customer relationships and close deals by generating summarized email conversations and suggested email replies.

## License requirements

To get started with this combined experience, you must have a Microsoft Copilot for Sales license. The Microsoft Copilot for Sales license includes a Copilot for Microsoft 365 license.

If you already have Copilot for Microsoft 365, you can add the step-up Copilot for Sales license to include all the role-based functionality and CRM connections.

If you're a Dynamics 365 Sales Premium customer, the sales specific functionality is included. The only purchase required is Copilot for Microsoft 365 for full Copilot for Sales functionality.
