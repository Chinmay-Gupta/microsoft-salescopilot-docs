# View suggested CRM updates

When interacting with your customers over email, you often need to update your CRM system with the latest information. Manually updating the CRM system every time you interact with customers via email can be time-consuming and error prone.

Copilot for Sales uses AI to suggest CRM updates based on the email conversations. Suggestions include update to budget and timeline of the opportunity to which the email is connected. If the email is not connected to an opportunity, you can choose an opportunity you want to update with the suggestions.

The suggestions are displayed in the **Suggested actions** card in the Copilot for Sales pane. If there are no suggestions, the card is not displayed.
