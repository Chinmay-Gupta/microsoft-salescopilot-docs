# View and understand the meeting summary

Sellers and their managers need an easy way to review the conversations they've had with their customers and quickly find relevant talking points, keywords, and insights.

The meeting summary page provides a high-level view of how the conversation with a customer went, and includes follow-up action items and relevant keywords, a timeline, a transcript of the call, and more.

## View the meeting summary

When the meeting summary is ready, you'll receive a message from the **Sales Copilot** bot in your personal chat. The message includes meeting details such as the title, date, time, and attendees, and a link to the summary. You can use the link in the message to view the summary or go to the **Sales Copilot** tab in the meeting.

- Go to the **Sales Copilot** bot in your chat list and select **Open summary**.

- Go to the meeting chat in your chat list, or open the event on your calendar in Teams, and select the **Sales Copilot** tab.

If there are multiple recordings of a single meeting (happens when you stop and restart the recording), or recordings of a recurring meeting, you can view the meeting summary of an individual meeting by selecting the date from the drop-down list in the meeting summary.

### Call transcript and translation

The **Transcript** section displays a written record of the call that you can read and translate, along with a timeline of the call.

### Call playback, timeline, and segmentation

Use the call playback feature to listen to the recorded call. You can listen to the entire call or drag the progress bar to skip to specific points on the timeline. The call transcript automatically scrolls to the point you select. You can also pause, rewind, and move forward through the call, and adjust the playback volume.

The timeline displays the sentiments detected in the conversation: positive, neutral, or negative. You can drag the progress bar to a specific point on the timeline. The call transcript automatically scrolls to the point you select.

When you select a word on the **Mentions** tab, a diamond icon on the playback timeline indicates the point at which the word was mentioned. If you hover over a word on the **Mentions** tab, gray diamond icons on the timeline indicate all the points at which the word was mentioned.

To quickly go to a comment in the transcript, select its icon on the timeline.

The timeline also indicates the conversation segments, such as introduction, solution, price quote, and call close. Select a segment to view insights that are relevant to it. The transcript scrolls to the start of the segment, and the segment is highlighted on the timeline. If the selected segment contains any action items or keywords, they're displayed on their respective tabs.

> [!NOTE]
> The playback capability is available only to the meeting organizer and call recorder.
