# Microsoft Sales Copilot for sellers

As a salesperson, you spend much of your time on administrative tasks, such as entering data in your CRM system to keep it up to date. For sellers, time is money and relationships are key. The time you spend entering data into your CRM could be dedicated to other essential tasks, such as meeting with new customers and selling.

Microsoft Sales Copilot is designed to help sellers work the way they want to without unnecessary context switching and manual data entry. It brings together the applications you work with daily, your CRM, Microsoft 365, and Microsoft Teams, to provide a more streamlined and AI-powered selling experience.

Now with Sales Copilot, externals contacts are connected to CRM contacts automatically. Data from your CRM populates in Sales Copilot, placing customer information at your fingertips. When you meet with customers in a Teams call, you can record and transcribe the meeting to get a rich summary using conversation intelligence.
