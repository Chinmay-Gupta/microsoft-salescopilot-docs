# Change the connected CRM contact

You could connect your Sales Copilot contact to a different CRM contact if you connected Sales Copilot contact to the wrong one of multiple contacts in your CRM, for instance.

1. Open the **Sales Copilot** contact pane and select the **Dynamics 365** or **Salesforce** tab.

1. Select the contact for which you want to change the connected CRM contact.

1. Select **Connect another record**.

   Sales Copilot suggests contacts to connect.

   :::image type="content" source="media/new-contact.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing choose a CRM to connect.":::

1. Select one of the suggested contacts or select **Create a new contact** to [create a new one](create-contact-crm-sales-copilot.md).

    If you don't connect to a different CRM contact, Sales Copilot retains the existing connection.
