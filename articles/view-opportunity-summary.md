# View opportunity summary

When reading an email or preparing for a meeting with a customer, you want to have relevant information from CRM, such as the customer asks, concerns, and notes, to help you get better context before the meeting.

Sales Copilot uses AI to generate a summary of each opportunity with key information like sales stage, budget, and close date. This helps you interact better with customers and boost sales and customer satisfaction.

If there are notes added to the opportunity, they are also summarized and displayed under the **Latest activity** section. If you've [saved an email summary to the opportunity](view-save-email-summary-crm.md#save-email-summary-to-crm), it's included in the summarized notes. The notes summary highlights any issues or concerns addressed within notes. It makes it easy to catch up on the latest updates and quickly prepare for meetings with potential buyers.

> [!NOTE]
>
>
> - The opportunity summary for an email is displayed only if the email is saved to CRM and connected to an opportunity.
>
> - If a meeting is not connected to an opportunity, the opportunity summary for the meeting is displayed based on the most relevant opportunity selected by AI. You'll get an option to select another opportunity and regenerate the suggested content.
