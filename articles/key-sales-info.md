# View key sales information in Copilot for Sales

As you read and compose emails in Outlook, you can use Copilot for Sales to view key sales information about the contacts, accounts, and opportunities that are related to the email. Key sales information is based on the opportunity that is connected to the email or the most relevant opportunity based on the contacts and accounts in the email. You can choose a different opportunity if the suggested opportunity is not the most relevant one.

> [!NOTE]
> With the premium license, you can see the integrated experience within Microsoft Outlook, which includes the ability to [view email summary](email-summary-premium.md) and [generate email replies](email-reply-premium.md). The key sales information provides a comprehensive CRM context overview.
