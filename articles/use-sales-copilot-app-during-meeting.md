# Use Copilot for Sales app during a meeting

With the Copilot for Sales app, you can view and edit the connected CRM record during the meeting in Teams. This helps you access and update the CRM record in the flow of your work.

> [!NOTE]
> You must [save and connect the meeting to a CRM record](save-outlook-activities-crm.md) to view details of the connected record.

## Open the Copilot for Sales app

Select the Copilot for Sales icon on the meeting toolbar. The Copilot for Sales panel opens on the right side of the meeting window.

> [!NOTE]
> You must invite at least one connected contact for Outlook to add the Copilot for Sales app to the meeting.

If the meeting is connected to an opportunity in CRM, an [opportunity summary](view-opportunity-summary.md) card is displayed on the **Highlights** tab showing the key details and status of the current opportunity.

On the **Dynamics 365** or **Salesforce** tab, the connected record is displayed in the **Connected to** card.
If the meeting is not connected and saved to CRM, a message is displayed to save and connect the meeting to a CRM record. For details about saving a meeting to CRM, see [Save Outlook activities to your CRM](save-outlook-activities-crm.md).

## View connected record details

1. [Open the Copilot for Sales app](#open-the-copilot-for-sales-app) and select the **Dynamics 365** or **Salesforce** tab.

1. In the **Connected to** card, select the record to see its details in the **Copilot for Sales** panel.

You can also open a record in CRM to view its complete details. The record details open in a new tab. Perform either of the following actions to open a record in CRM:

- Open the record details in the **Copilot for Sales** panel, select **More actions** (**...**), and then select **Open in Dynamics 365** or **Open in Salesforce**.

- In the **Dynamics 365** or **Salesforce** tab, hover over the record, select **More actions** (**...**), and then select **Open in Dynamics 365** or **Open in Salesforce**.

## Copy link to connected record

You can copy a link to the connected record and then share it in a Teams chat or an email message. When you paste the record's link into Teams chat, it will unfurl into a rich adaptive card. When you paste the record's link in an email message, a link to the record is pasted.

1. [Open the Copilot for Sales app](#open-the-copilot-for-sales-app) and select the **Dynamics 365** or **Salesforce** tab.

1. Hover over the record and select **More actions** (**...**) > **Copy link**.

Alternately, you can select the connected record to open its details, and then select **More actions** (**...**) > **Copy link**.
