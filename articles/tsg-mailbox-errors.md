## Root cause and resolution

### Issue 1: One or more sync errors have occurred with server-side synchronization

#### Root cause

Sales Copilot requires server-side synchronization to synchronize emails and meetings to Dynamics 365. When server-side synchronization encounters an error while attempting the synchronization, Sales Copilot detects and displays this error message for the user to take action and resolve the error.

#### Resolution

To resolve the error, you must locate the specific error as part of the mailbox alert wall, read the description, and take action. User can also delete the error to suppress it.

1. Open the CRM instance you connected to Sales Copilot.

    > [!NOTE]
    > To get the CRM instance URL, select **Options** (**…**) in the upper-right corner of the Sales Copilot pane. The URL is displayed under **Signed in to Dynamics 365**.

2. Select **Settings** > **Personalization Settings**.
