> - When you install the Outlook add-in, it's considered user-deployed instead of admin-deployed and will not have full feature support.

However, you can manually add Sales Copilot to the meeting to get meeting summaries.
> - You may not be able to install Sales Copilot if downloading add-ins is turned off for your organization. In this case, contact your administrator.
> - If you are using the Dynamics 365 app for Outlook, you can consider switching to Sales Copilot, as you can do much more with Sales Copilot. More information: [Difference between Sales Copilot and Dynamics 365 app for Outlook](#difference-between-sales-copilot-and-dynamics-365-app-for-outlook)
