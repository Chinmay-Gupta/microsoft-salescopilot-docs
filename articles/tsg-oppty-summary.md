## Root cause and resolution

### Issue 1: Copilot for Sales Teams app isn't installed

#### Root cause

When you set up a deal room from Copilot for Sales in Outlook, the Copilot for Sales Teams app and bot are automatically installed for the selected team, and opportunity summary is displayed in the deal room.

To resolve this issue, you must manually install the Copilot for Sales Teams app and bot for the team, and then generate the opportunity summary again.

1. In Microsoft Teams, hover over the team name, and then select **More options (...)** > **Manage team**.

2. Go to the Apps tab, and then select **Get more apps**.

3. Search for **Copilot for Sales**, and then select its card.

4. Select the down arrow next to **Open**, and then select **Add to a team**.

    The **Add Copilot for Sales to a team** dialog box is displayed with the team name preselected.

5. Select **Set up a bot**.
