## Root cause and resolution

### Issue 1: Sales Copilot Teams app is not installed

#### Root cause

When you set up a deal room from Sales Copilot in Outlook, the Sales Copilot Teams app and bot are automatically installed for the selected team and opportunity summary is displayed in the deal room. If the Sales Copilot Teams app is not installed for the team, a message is displayed instead of the opportunity summary in the deal room.

#### Resolution

To resolve this issue, you must manually install the Sales Copilot Teams app and bot for the team, and then generate the opportunity summary again.

1. In Microsoft Teams, hover over the team name, and then select **More options (...)** > **Manage team**.

2. Go to the Apps tab, and then select **Get more apps**.

3. Search for **Sales Copilot**, and then select its card.

4. Select the down arrow next to **Open**, and then select **Add to a team**.

    The **Add Sales Copilot to a team** dialog box is displayed with the team name preselected.

5. Select **Set up a bot**.
