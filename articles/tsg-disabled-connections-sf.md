## Root cause and resolution

### Issue 1: The Salesforce connection is disabled

#### Root cause

Data Loss Prevention (DLP) is enabled on the default environment in the tenant thereby blocking the Salesforce connector. Therefore, existing connections to Salesforce have been disabled.

#### Resolution

1. Sign out from Sales Copilot and close the Sales Copilot pane.
1. Reopen the Sales Copilot pane and sign in to Salesforce.

> [!NOTE]
> If the issue is not resolved, see [Unable to sign in to Salesforce due to blocked Salesforce connector](tsg-blocked-connector-sf.md) to unblock the Salesforce connector in DLP policy.
