## Root cause and resolution

### Issue 1: User doesn't have edit access to a record in Salesforce

#### Root cause

When a user tries to edit a record, Copilot for Sales checks if the user has edit access to the object and record in Salesforce. If the user has edit access to the object but not to the record, the error message is displayed.

#### Resolution

Salesforce administrator must provide edit access to the record in Salesforce by [manually sharing the record with the user](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.granting_access_to_records.htm&type=5).
