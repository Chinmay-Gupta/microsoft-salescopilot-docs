# Collaboration space in Sales Copilot

Collaboration space exists in physical as well as digital worlds. In the physical world, a collaboration space is where sellers engage with their customers in a conference room. In the digital world, a collaboration space is a virtual meeting room where sellers engage with their customers using apps such as Teams or Outlook. These digital workspaces used for collaboration have grown over the past few years, but largely exist outside the context of business data.

Sellers often face an inability to quickly create teams and channels with the right people and the right information that is organized in a predictable manner. This often results in the creation of multiple Teams channels and fragmented information that is hard to discover. To mitigate this challenge, you can use sales templates to create a collaboration space in Microsoft Teams. A collaboration space created using a sales template brings together the right members, contextual data, and productivity apps to boost group collaboration in Teams.

Sales templates facilitate the creation of teams and channels and come prepackaged with a set of capabilities that jump starts collaboration. This not only saves time but also ensures that collaboration is organized and efficient. By using sales templates to create a collaboration space, sellers can focus on engaging with customers and driving business outcomes, rather than spending time organizing and searching for information.

## What is a sales template?

A sales template streamlines setting up a team and channel in Microsoft Teams with CRM records linked for easy access to business data in the flow of work. Templates come with pre-defined channels and pre pinned apps. You can create a collaboration space using either an account team template or a deal room template.

### Account team template

Allows you to collaborate on account related activities. Account team template is applied at a team level and is linked to a CRM account. Two default channels (general and shared) are created. The general channel is used for collaboration with people within your organization and the shared channel is used for collaboration with people outside your organization such as customers. The CRM account is added to the general channel to help you access relevant business data in the context of your work. Pre-pinned apps (Files with starter folders, links to existing CRM storage locations, and OneNote) are available to boost your productivity.

### Deal room template

Allows you to collaborate on opportunity related activities. Deal room template is applied at a channel level and is linked to a CRM opportunity. The opportunity channel is recommended to be created under the team linked to the parent account, if available. If a parent account is not linked to a team, a new team can be created to collaborate on opportunities. This channel is used to collaborate with people within your organization. An option is provided to create a separate shared channel to collaborate with people outside your organization. Pre-pinned apps (Files with starter folders, links to existing CRM storage locations, and OneNote) are available to boost your productivity.
